/* Objects, in JavaScript, are the most important data type and form the building blocks for modern JavaScript. 
These objects are quite different from JavaScriptâ€™s primitive data types
(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined, and symbol) in the sense that these primitive data types all store a single value each (depending on their types).  */
