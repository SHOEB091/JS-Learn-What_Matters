//VARIABLES AND CONSTANTS 

score = 7
lives =0



/*In JavaScript, you can declare variables using var, let, and const keywords.

Here's how you can declare variables and constants in JavaScript:*/

// Using var
var score = 7;

// Using let
let lives = 0;

// Using const
const maxLives = 9;


/*
var is function scoped and it can be redeclared and updated.

--window object: When you declare a variable using var, the JavaScript engine assigns it to the window object.
var adds it to the window object

function abcd()
{
    for(var i=0;i,12;i++)
        {
            console.log(i);
        }
        console.log(i);
}

let is block scoped and it can be updated but not redeclared.

function abcd()
{
    for(let i=0;i,12;i++)
        {
            console.log(i);
        }
        console.log(i);
}

const is also block scoped but it cannot be updated or redeclared. It's used for constant values, which means the value of the variable cannot be changed once it is set.
